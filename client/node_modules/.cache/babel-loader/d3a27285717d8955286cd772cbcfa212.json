A full week can sometimes be less than\r\n * or more than 7*24 hours if a daylight savings change happens between two dates.\r\n *\r\n * To ignore DST and only measure exact 7*24-hour periods, use this instead:\r\n * `Math.floor(differenceInHours(dateLeft, dateRight)/(7*24))|0`.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:\r\n *\r\n * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).\r\n *\r\n * @param {Date|Number} dateLeft - the later date\r\n * @param {Date|Number} dateRight - the earlier date\r\n * @returns {Number} the number of full weeks\r\n * @throws {TypeError} 2 arguments required\r\n *\r\n * @example\r\n * // How many full weeks are between 5 July 2014 and 20 July 2014?\r\n * var result = differenceInWeeks(new Date(2014, 6, 20), new Date(2014, 6, 5))\r\n * //=> 2\r\n *\r\n * // How many full weeks are between\r\n * // 1 March 2020 0:00 and 6 June 2020 0:00 ?\r\n * // Note: because local time is used, the\r\n * // result will always be 8 weeks (54 days),\r\n * // even if DST starts and the period has\r\n * // only 54*24-1 hours.\r\n * var result = differenceInWeeks(\r\n *   new Date(2020, 5, 1),\r\n *   new Date(2020, 2, 6)\r\n * )\r\n * //=> 8\r\n */\n\nexport default function differenceInWeeks(dirtyDateLeft, dirtyDateRight) {\n  requiredArgs(2, arguments);\n  var diff = differenceInDays(dirtyDateLeft, dirtyDateRight) / 7;\n  return diff > 0 ?
